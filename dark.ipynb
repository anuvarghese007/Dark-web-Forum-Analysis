Thank you for this awesome community. This first post includes a few changes from the last days. Let's start:Changelog from Wednesday, 26th Ocotober 2016Added a searchbar to increase the filtering.You'll now get a reminding notification for old orders which are not not rated yet. Rating is a core part for every market and vendor. You can rate orders up to 42 days after they completed. You will get a notification after 14 and after 28 days. Don't worry about may forgetting one unrated order. PGP-Messages are now displayed in a text-box. That makes it easy to copy & paste it via CTRL+A (to select the whole content of the text-box) instead of annoying selecting text with your mouse.4 design-bugs are fixed. 1 minor internal bug has been fixed.

When you set up an account to sell digital items it asks you to enter logs. Are these logs a line by line of the data that you are selling? Or, are these simply references (log1, log2, etc.) to the individual data sets that you will be selling and a method for keeping track of each data set? By the looks of the example provided in the set up process (login1234567, passw12345456), it would seem that this is actually data being sold as it corresponds to a login and password for a website for example....

       " '\\nThere are two main trusted tumblers and a third which was just re-launched that I will post here along with some information about each. I will also post an extra free method that you can use on top of tumbling.First - BitBlender. This service has been around for quite some time and is one of the trusted tumblers. BitBlender works with a shared coin system (one huge wallet sending many small payments) while the others seem more sophisticated (many wallets bigger than your deposit that will send amounts to the addresses you gave). In both cases it should work as far as blockchain analysis goes. (Thanks Wilderness.) BitBlender also has a high volume bonus program where if you send 10+ BTC within 7 days your fee goes down by 0.5%. They also have a referral program where once combined deposits from a user and his/her referred users reaches 10BTC in 7 days, the referring user will be credited 0.5% of all deposits.Fee: Randomized 1-3%BitBlender - http://bitblendervrfkzr.onion/Second - Helix by Grams. Grams started in April of 2014 as a simple search engine for products on the markets. After a few months they started Helix and have since created many useful services such as TorAds, InfoDesk, and GramsFlow. Helix has a regular version which requires a grams account, and a light version which does not. The full version of Helix has more fine-tuned controls like delays and sending the clean coins in more than one transaction. In the light version you send your coins to the address it gives you and as soon as it gets 2 confirmations it sends the cleaned coins (in one transaction) to your specified address. In the light version it can take up to 2 hours but most transactions are completed within 30 minutes.Fee: 2.5%Minimum withdrawal amount: 0.02 BTCMaximum withdrawal amount: 21 BTCHelix account cost (not needed for Helix Light): 0.01 BTCHelix: http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix/light/Third - WashBit.IO. WashBit has been just relaunched. It doesn\\'t keep any information about there users. This site does not run any javascript and you are recommended to use there tor gateway, which is run at washbitesg722gpa.onion. You can find more information in there BitcoinTalk thread. Fee: 0.1 -1.1%WashBit: http://washbit.io/WashBit Tor: http://washbitesg722gpa.onion/Pay Shield by SIGAINT. SIGAINT has been one of the trusted darknet email service providers for about a year now and has just announced their new tumbler on 16 June. I have not had a chance to try it yet but it claims to complete the tumble in 30 minutes. What\\'s unique about Pay Shield is that it has a \"Pay someone with mixed coins\" feature. From their website: \"[Pay someone with mixed coins] is primarily used to pay someone else with maximum privacy. Simply input the payees\\' Bitcoin address and the amount they expect and Pay Shield will generate a mix for you and calculate how much you need to send to make the mix work out to that amount.\"Fee: Randomized ~1%Pay Shield: http://payshld6oxbu5eft.onionNew edit: Bitmixer.io Another popular mixing services with good reputation. You can find many good replies in their bitcoin talk thread. One of the first services ever.Fee:\\xa0 0.5% plus 0.0005 BTCBitmixer: http://bitmixegkuerln7q.onion/Now on to the free method. This is not recommended as a stand-alone method. There are many websites that store a large amount of bitcoins - stores, casinos, exchanges, etc. I personally use casino websites - send in your BTC, play a few rounds (penny slots or you\\'ll regret it) and send it to your final destination. You can also send to your preferred website of choice first before sending it to your tumbler. With exchanges, it\\'s best to find one where you can send your BTC and convert to LTC or another currency, then back to BTC.*Please beware of Phishing links. I highly recommend using dnstats.com or we love Avengers to confirm you are always using the correct address. these sites have been providing Darknet market info for years and can be trusted.

It is the internet’s most comprehensive cocaine reference and information website and it is an onion domain! http://cocaineo5z66elwy.onionDid you know that for nearly the last two decades there has been a very dangerous adulterant that is basically a poison that is being added to much of the cocaine made in South America? It is called levamisole and it needs to be avoided if at all possible! This is why I and many other cocaine advocates are having the cola vendors’ batches laboratory tested as a regular thing. You can learn much about levamisole by going here:http://cocaineo5z66elwy.onion/Levamisol … oison.htmlOne of the best and most informative books written about cocaine has been out of print for some time now and it is very difficult to obtain an actual copy of the book, but you can find the entire book in the HTML format there.

The DNMs should be a place where we can be sure that we are buying safer quality drugs than what we can obtain from the streets. Therefore we need to learn about what can be the dangerous adulterants in the drugs we are buying.As for cocaine the one that is showing up most often that is particularly dangerous is LEVAMISOLE. For a better understanding of the whats and the whys there is a well written series of articles by the free weekly publication from Seattle, WA, USA “The Stranger”.

That's 50 euro's in merchandise and all top knotch, 5 different types of psychedelics! Visit and follow DutchDrugzsupport on Reddit for more info and to make sure you can participate next time. I will post future promo's there first and you'll be the first on every update. Visit --> DutchDrugzSupport on Reddit.Very pleased with the fact Dark Heroes League accepted my vendor application, they gave me a very fast and warm welcome! Like the site and security features, great staff untill now . Friendly warning not to use Apple Market, they are scamming their vendors and buyers with funds!For those who don't know me, I'm a top vendor from EVO with over 2500 sales and a longtime entrepreneur in the offline Dutch drugtrade. I started in this business years ago out of frustration with the poor quality on the streets and the lack of interest in quality, purity and health from my former dealers. I'm a psychonaut myself, and truly believe certain drugs, psychedelics in particular, can make social, cultural and ego paradigms dissapear and make you reconnect with nature, the universe and your true self. Only in moderation, drugs need to be an expander of your brain, not a destroyer! In the Netherlands it's possible for users to test drugs through an official government labtest, thus I know exactly what I sell.Products:Mescaline - €100,- per gram. LSD - from €5,- per blotter down to €3,75 per blotter. (for now only 5 euro's per blotter available due to extreme prices)DOM - from €3,- down to €1,- per blotter.DOB - from €3,- down to €1,- per blotter.N,N DMT, from €120,- down to €110,- per gram, pure and less toxic process, the Spirit Molecule!!4-ACO-DMT - €100 per gram.Ketamine - from €40,- down to €25,- per gram.MDMA - from €15,- down to €10,- (!) per gram.XTC Pills - from €5,- down to €3,- per pill.2C-B Pills - from €3,- down to €2,- per pill.Kamagra - €10,- per strip of 4 x 100 mg sildenafil citrate (Generic Viagra).★Self Defence:Professional Tazer 5000 KVOLT || 5.000.000 Volts - €30,-Shipping above €60,- allways FREE!At times homegrown cannabis, grown with love and completely bio. Still looking for reliable and normal priced sources of DHP, DOC, DOI, Opium and (liquid) Psilocybin. If you can deliver, let me know! I allways update my stock on the fora.

       " \"\\n[h1]Try the newest and best way to take bars, on blotter paper![/h1]You'll get 4 count of my 3mg alprazolam blotters with this free sample!\\xa0 --Only 10 samples available, get one while they're available!Hey y'all!\\xa0 I'm new to Wall Street Market, but have been on Dream, Hansa, and TradeRoute for a while.\\xa0 \\xa0Also check reddit for other reviews. Each rectangle image of a bar contains 3mg of alprazolam (xanax).\\xa0 These things are awesome. -They hit you within minutes, much faster than the pills (even when the pills are chewed/crushed)-They are much easier to conceal and transport than actual bar pills.\\xa0 -Sheets are now perforated around each rectangle image of a bar for easy tear-off and accurate dosingBlotter Alprazolam is a relatively new ingestion method, although blotters are not new.\\xa0 I'm sure you've heard of LSD layed on blotter paper.\\xa0 Laying the alprazolam on blotter paper is a similar process.\\xa0 The actual bar pills consist of almost all filler and binder in order to make easily handled portions for the user.\\xa0 A pharmacy xanax bar contains 2mg of alprazolam, which is an extremely tiny amount of powder, very difficult to portion correctly if in straight powder form.\\xa0 Licking your fingertip with some of the pure powder would put most people out for many many hours.\\xa0 So, the pharmacies (and many people with pill presses) mix a very tiny amount of the alprazolam powder with binder and filler, then press together the little white bar-shaped pills using a tiny mold and a press.\\xa0 With blotters, the process is as follows:A carefully measured amount of alprazolam is dissolved in a solvent.\\xa0 The solution is then soaked into a high-quality, thick, and very absorbent paper.\\xa0 The solvent is then evaporated, leaving behind only the alprazolam evenly distributed throughout each sheet of paper.\\xa0 The sheets are then perforated for easy tear-off.\\xa0 This process has undergone MANY revisions and improvements, and while I'm always looking for ways to make the process better, they come out pretty dang nice using the process I've developed so far. The blotters are made in sheets of 288, then they are perforated around each image of a bar pill that's printed on the paper so that a 3mg dose can easily and accurately be torn off without using scissors.\\xa0 The 3mg doses can be torn into smaller portions for lower doses.\\xa0 3mg is a pretty heavy dose for a user with no tolerance.\\xa0 Blotter alprazolam can be consumed a number of ways.\\xa0 I suggest keeping the desired dose in your mouth for 5-10 minutes. It can be left under or on the tongue, or chewed a little, whatever is preferred.\\xa0 After that, the paper can be spit out.\\xa0 Swallowing the paper is ok too if desired, but if held in the mouth for the suggested 5-10 minutes, by that time most if not all of the alprazolam will have soaked out of the paper anyways.\\xa0 Although the paper and ink used are both non-toxic, it just seems better to not swallow little pieces of paper all the time.\\xa0 It seems that most users enjoy the distinct bitter taste of alprazolam, but there are others who do not care for it.\\xa0 For those who don't want to taste it when ingesting, I suggest getting some clear gelcaps from a health food store, then putting the desired dose in one of the gelcaps and swallowing it.\\xa0 Cutting or tearing up the desired dose before putting it in the gelcap would most likely aid in the digestive process.\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nFellow Darketeers, Psychonauts and Customers,Because it's more in line with my world views, I'm now offering pure and medically grade Cannabis Oil. Thankfully Cannabis oil or tinctures are getting more and more positive PR, in the Medical world, but also in the Media and independent scientific research. If you search on the internet for products based on cannabis oil, you’ll find mainly CBD and THC oils, but there are over 200 other medicinal compounds in high quality weed that improve your bodily functions, the so-called endocannabinoid system. Cannabis is the only plant with an complete endocannabinoid system, many researchers claim Marijuana is an plant-based copy of mammals. This explains the many health benefits and improvements on bodily and chemically functions within an organism.Besides having a positive result on your overall health, more and more proof is piling up that THC destroys many types of cancer cells and makes your body more efficient to fight diseases, like auto-immune conditions, mental conditions, metabolism dysfunctions and many, MANY more. The sad reality is that this has been known since 1972. But because “drugs are bad mmmmkay”, all research was abandoned, and many reputations of dedicated researchers have been destroyed to keep this information hidden.If you want to see the studies, litterally 100's of them –-> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cannabinoidsI have been making this for a few years now, but because we use extreme high quality weed and only the flowers (buds), and have a very time consuming process because we don’t heat the product, we cannot offer our oil for less than 30 euro’s per ML. Oils now available are heavily diluted and even mixed with Omega 6 rich oils, like sunflower oil, the opposite of what a sick body needs. Second problem with buying oil is that every producer I used, dilutes their oil to at least 1 to 5, but mostly 1 to 10. So for every ML you buy, 0.9 ML is simply sunflower oil or even worse.The big difference in this oil is that it's extracted from 50% Sativa (Haze) and 50% Indica (Bubble Gum), to get the most medically potent end product. This oil is rich in THC, CBD, Terpenes but also the other 200+ cannabinoids which they recently began to research, due to the restrictions that were in place since the 1930's. Secondly, our process destroys not a single compound, due to low temperatures. Lastly, we only add high quality olive oil, for every ML produced, we add 1 ML of olive oil. This is not for money, but simply to make the oil more usable and easier to dose. Also, pure cannabis oil isn't workable, one drop would get you higher than you ever been! In every ML there's a guaranteed amount of 3 to 5 grams of high quality weed in it.Benefits Some of the most important health benefits of cannabis oil include but are not limited to; Reduce stress and anxiety, improve the quality of sleep, boost appetite and optimize digestion, reduce pain, prevent and fight most cancers, strengthen heart health, and protect your skin, combat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, Epilepsy and Tourette’s syndrome, and various eye conditions by lowering the eyeball pressure.Dosage & UseOil takes much longer to process in your body, some people feel the effects only after 2 to 3 hours. Don't ever swallow it, let it be absorbed in your mouth, that way your stomach acid won't destroy most of the compounds. The most efficient way to take this is rectally, since the complete oil will be absorbed without destroying any of it. This is only necessary if you battle with cancer. FOR OVERALL HEALTH 1 to 2 drops per day, if you don’t like the psychoactive effect, just take it one hour before sleep. Be aware that this oil is EXTREMELY potent, you will get high if you take it while awake. CANCER In terms of cancer, the suggestion is to have three doses of cannabis oil each day, and gradually increase the amount until 1 ML per day is consumed. A full treatment is believed to take 90 days.ShippingMy stealth is excellent, odorless, discreet and just plain normal looking letters, no track&trace. Shipping for all orders above €60,- is free! Netherlands 5 days International 15 days (No USA)PricesPure Cannabis Oil €30,- per 1 Milliliter, which are about 16 drops. Bigger listings will follow, first need to test shipping procedures and such.Very glad to have finally added this to the shop, in stead of just drugs, this is a cure and medicine to many ailments, and it has been used for 1000's of years before us. Recreational drug use can have many positive effects, but this is nothing recreational, it would be a waist to smoke this beautifull and potent product.I only buy and sell quality items. I will respond within 24/48 hours. See my profile for my terms of service.My products are from extraordinary quality, use with care. If you don't feel anything just wait, unless you're VERY experienced and know your limit is high. Enjoy but don't use too often, takes the fun outa it!\\nOur vendor market, Psychedelicum, check the link @deepdotweb for safety!Wallstreet --> http://wallst4qihu6lvsa.onion/profile/DutchDrugzDream --> http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/contactMe … DutchdrugzLove, Peace and meaningful trips wished upon everyone!\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\nFellow Darketeers, Psychonauts and Customers,Because it's more in line with my world views, I'm now offering pure and medically grade Cannabis Oil. Thankfully Cannabis oil or tinctures are getting more and more positive PR, in the Medical world, but also in the Media and independent scientific research. If you search on the internet for products based on cannabis oil, you’ll find mainly CBD and THC oils, but there are over 200 other medicinal compounds in high quality weed that improve your bodily functions, the so-called endocannabinoid system. Cannabis is the only plant with an complete endocannabinoid system, many researchers claim Marijuana is an plant-based copy of mammals. This explains the many health benefits and improvements on bodily and chemically functions within an organism.Besides having a positive result on your overall health, more and more proof is piling up that THC destroys many types of cancer cells and makes your body more efficient to fight diseases, like auto-immune conditions, mental conditions, metabolism dysfunctions and many, MANY more. The sad reality is that this has been known since 1972. But because “drugs are bad mmmmkay”, all research was abandoned, and many reputations of dedicated researchers have been destroyed to keep this information hidden.If you want to see the studies, litterally 100's of them –-> www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cannabinoidsI have been making this for a few years now, but because we use extreme high quality weed and only the flowers (buds), and have a very time consuming process because we don’t heat the product, we cannot offer our oil for less than 30 euro’s per ML. Oils now available are heavily diluted and even mixed with Omega 6 rich oils, like sunflower oil, the opposite of what a sick body needs. Second problem with buying oil is that every producer I used, dilutes their oil to at least 1 to 5, but mostly 1 to 10. So for every ML you buy, 0.9 ML is simply sunflower oil or even worse.The big difference in this oil is that it's extracted from 50% Sativa (Haze) and 50% Indica (Bubble Gum), to get the most medically potent end product. This oil is rich in THC, CBD, Terpenes but also the other 200+ cannabinoids which they recently began to research, due to the restrictions that were in place since the 1930's. Secondly, our process destroys not a single compound, due to low temperatures. Lastly, we only add high quality olive oil, for every ML produced, we add 1 ML of olive oil. This is not for money, but simply to make the oil more usable and easier to dose. Also, pure cannabis oil isn't workable, one drop would get you higher than you ever been! In every ML there's a guaranteed amount of 3 to 5 grams of high quality weed in it.Benefits Some of the most important health benefits of cannabis oil include but are not limited to; Reduce stress and anxiety, improve the quality of sleep, boost appetite and optimize digestion, reduce pain, prevent and fight most cancers, strengthen heart health, and protect your skin, combat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, Epilepsy and Tourette’s syndrome, and various eye conditions by lowering the eyeball pressure.Dosage & UseOil takes much longer to process in your body, some people feel the effects only after 2 to 3 hours. Don't ever swallow it, let it be absorbed in your mouth, that way your stomach acid won't destroy most of the compounds. The most efficient way to take this is rectally, since the complete oil will be absorbed without destroying any of it. This is only necessary if you battle with cancer. FOR OVERALL HEALTH 1 to 2 drops per day, if you don’t like the psychoactive effect, just take it one hour before sleep. Be aware that this oil is EXTREMELY potent, you will get high if you take it while awake. CANCER In terms of cancer, the suggestion is to have three doses of cannabis oil each day, and gradually increase the amount until 1 ML per day is consumed. A full treatment is believed to take 90 days.ShippingMy stealth is excellent, odorless, discreet and just plain normal looking letters, no track&trace. Shipping for all orders above €60,- is free! Netherlands 5 days International 15 days (No USA)PricesPure Cannabis Oil €30,- per 1 Milliliter, which are about 16 drops. Bigger listings will follow, first need to test shipping procedures and such.Very glad to have finally added this to the shop, in stead of just drugs, this is a cure and medicine to many ailments, and it has been used for 1000's of years before us. Recreational drug use can have many positive effects, but this is nothing recreational, it would be a waist to smoke this beautifull and potent product.I only buy and sell quality items. I will respond within 24/48 hours. See my profile for my terms of service.My products are from extraordinary quality, use with care. If you don't feel anything just wait, unless you're VERY experienced and know your limit is high.

This is why I demand the real name of the residents stated on the given address. If this is not the case, customers will lose the privilege for a reship or a refund. There are ways to check this so please meet my request.You can create the correct address format using the following link :http://www.addressdoctor.com/en/countri … rmats.html★-----------------★Refund Policy★-----------------★In a rare case of a None arriving package the buyer can choose between a full Reship or a 50% refund.Refunds and reships will be done in case of prove of non arrival such as a letter from customs. We will try to handle the situation as good as possible.<< ORDERING FROM US – Please read, both new AND old buyers >>When ordering. We cannot accept any fake names/addresses, OR P.O. BOXES anymore (this is a NEW change) due to OPSEC security and the failure rates we’ve experienced.USPS knows when using a fake name and an address don’t correspond and these packages are typically rejected, sent back to our own “fake addresses” where the package will then get completely lost in shipment. We will NOT re-ship if you use a fake name or address and it fails to arrive. As for P.O. Boxes, we now require your REAL address for OPSEC security due to information we have recently acquired from USPS and to follow proper shipping security when ordering.<br />What we sell is Roche/valium/diazepam/Viagra/OFFICIAL:MA HolderTeva UK for all LimitedOur officail email is External contact is not allowedRoche/valium/diazepam/100 tabs 75 gbp250 tabs 190 gbp500 tabs 280 gbp1000 tabs 650 gbpDaz Diazepam 10mg blisters Safe Pharma500 tabs 280 gbp1000s 650 gbppfizer xanax alprazolam purple footballs 1mg100 tabs 85 gbp250 tabs 150 gbp500 tabs 220 gbp1000 tabs 380 gbp2000 tabs 720 gbp<p>Other Benzos and Sleepiing medications for sale<p>Nitrazepam mogadon 5mg valeant karachi100 tabs 85 gbp250 tabs 150 gbp500 tabs 220 gbp1000 tabs 380 gbp2000 tabs 720 gbpRestoril temazepam novartis 30mg\\xa0 capsules250 tabs 85 gbp500 tabs 90 gbp1000 tabs 155 gbp2000 tabs 290 gbp<p>Hypnotil Temazpeam 30mg250 tabs 70 gbp500 tabs 90 gbp1000 tabs 145 gbp2000 tabs 270 gbpTemazepam eggs Temazepam jelly babes 30mg green temazepam eggs50 temazepam 30mg jelly babes eggs green temazepam eggs 60 gbp100 temazepam 30mg jelly babes eggs green temazepam eggs 90 gbp200 temazepam 30mg jelly babes eggs green temazepam eggs 175 gbp<p>Roche bromazepam Lexotan 3mg roche limited karachi pakistan100 tabs 85 gbp250 tabs 150 gbp500 tabs 220 gbp1000 tabs 380 gbp2000 tabs 720 gbp<p>Generic bromazepam 3mg250 tabs 95 gbp500 tabs 125 gbp1000 tabs 165 gbp2000 tabs 290 gbp<p>Roche Rivotril 2mg Clonazepam100 tabs 75 gbp250 tabs 85 gbp500 tabs 120 gbp1000 tabs 230 gbp2000 tabs 410 gbp<p>Roche Rivotril Clonazepam .5mg Roche500 tabs 120 gbp1000 tabs 200 gbpContact: External contact is not allowed for all inquiry's and orders.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nEditors Note:VirWox wised up to this method and started forcing users to validate their SL avatars..Thought I\\'d tidy this up a bit with a noob-friendly tutorial on how to buy bitcoins with a CVV through VirWox.Method 1: CC -> SLL -> BTCWhat you will need.Valid CVV (any country will do) [1]Clean Socks5 proxy as close as possible to cardholder\\'s address [2] 3 Good DNS setup [3]Ok lets get started.You\\'ll need an email account. Go create a new one at yahoo/External contact is not allowed/whatever.....doesn\\'t matter which (i wouldn\\'t use tormail for this......too much of a flag). Go to Here, and create a new account using the email you just set up and the name on the CVV. Just make up a fake SL avatar - you don\\'t need to validate it. You will then have to confirm your new account by retrieving the temp password from your email. First thing to do in Here is change your password in the \"ChangeSettings\" tab on the left. Now we\\'re ready to do some carding. Click \"deposit\" and scroll down to the Skrill(moneybookers) option. Then enter the max amount for the currency of 1 your card (currently $56 for USA cards) and click the moneybookers logo.If you have NoScript installed you will have to temporarily allow all this page. Enter the details you have for the CVV and make up a fake date of birth if you dont have a genuine one. If all goes well, you will then be taken back to the main page with your USD/EUR/GBP balance filled.On the \"exchange\" menu left of screen choose USD/SLL to convert to Linden $s, then BTC/SLL to convert to bitcoin.Now withdraw. Easy Profit.Note:Typically Virwox hold funds for 48 hours before releasing.You can process payments a total of 3 times with each card.....one transaction every 24hours.CC -> Moneygram -> BTCIf you have fulls (ssn, dob, etc) you can try cashing out through moneygram. To do this just go to site and sign up for an account under the cardholders name. Be sure to chain a regional socks5 with your Tor connection so you appear to be from the same country that the cardholder is in [4]. Select Same Day service. It will prompt you for the carddetails, dob, and the last 4 digits of the ssn. I would suggest running this name through a background check (any background search site willdo) in case you have to answer a security question to send the funds over. Don\\'t try to send over too much. If you accidentally go over the limit or try to send a suspicious amount you risk flagging the account. No more than $300 from each CC. If everything goes smoothly you can try exchangingThank you\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nChangelog from Thursday, 06th July 2017It is happening fellow mates.A new part of history in our market has just begun. Until now it was a pleasure to work with bitcoin mates, but from now on you have to share our market with monero people. WallStreet Market is proud to announce that we´re finally integrated active monero support without a deposit system. Just order how do you already know from bitcoin on our market and transfer the specified funds to the shown wallet. When a vendor supports Monero and BitCoin, simply choose your favorite coin and checkout. More follow soon. It took a lot of time to get this done with testing and coding. So when you notice an error or an bug feel free to get in touch with us. Our development team will get rid of it.--- DETAILS ---YES! Monero is here!What is Monero?Quick: Monero is a cryptocurrency like bitcoin.But.. why did we add that? 2 reasons:- Bitcoin scaling debate; Bitcoin is slowly sinking. It's core techniques are not ready wide-use. It can't handle much transactions. Due to the scaling debate and some other points we lost some trust in bitcoin. But it's still a extreme trustful cryptocurrency as it is the longest alive. - Privacy problems. Bitcoins public attention has a dark side. A lot of companies and governments are currently developing tracking programs for bitcoin. Monero solves that by new cryptographic methods. Nobody knows how much coins you own or to who you send your coins. Monero is now on WSM. What do I need to know ?Vendors are now able to activate monero payments on their offers. They just need to add a receiving monero address like on bitcoin payments. You see on offer listings and details the bitcoin and monero logo (if the offer supports the cryptocurrency). Bitcoin is still available as you know it. We hope you enjoy our service. Please remember: If you have any suggestions, please write a support ticket on our market site.We're a but busy working an a new big feature for WSM - and we're also planning even more big changes very soon ~ WSM technical Operator\\n\",\n",

Nach dem Trocknen erhält man ein weißes, amorphes Pulver mit typischem Amingeruch. Es löst sich vollständig in destilliertem Wasser. Der pH-Wert entspricht genau 7, weswegen es beim Ziehen kaum brennt. 5 bis 10 Minuten nach dem Ziehen geht es los: Wachheit, Energie, Tatendrang, Euphorie, Redseligkeit, angenehmer Bodyload (Kribbeln).

I just wanna know if there's anyone else transitioning to WSM to find a better platform due to the current AB chaos going on right now.Also, is anyone here interested in the type of goods I sell that I aforementioned?I hope to be apart of this community, and am interested in your feedback.Cheers! \\n\",\n",

I'm a vendor from alpha and dream but for some reason this wall street account is no longer accessible... when I try to sign up for a new account with the same name it says it has already been taken... I can verify my pgp key but I'm not sure if I registered using my old 256 AES key instead of the new 4096 bit key... here it is anyway so you can verify me against my key on DREAM. If possible is it to access this Escapeservice account or will I need to setup a new one... also is it possible to get refugee status if this account does not already have vendor status? thanks in advance-ES-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA512-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG 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Lo35-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\",\n",

Specific and unique resources. How to create Fulls from scatch (for those that want to really experiment themselves) and how to get bank accounts reliable enought for your Carding Operations.Stripe Setup - How to create a Stripe setup with 2 day payments that will really bring you money. I\\'ll touch here lots of urban myths/legends that are stopping you from making money fast, easy and consistent. I know most of you think this is overrated, but trust me, Stripe is alive, is well and easy to work with (easy for the ones that will order the guide, as for me to get to this distiled method...made me loose tons of money and about 50-60 setups). Many PRO might think is nothing new, but trust me, even PRO carders, from time to time need new informations. I\\'ll teach you how to get 2 days payments, how to stop receiving \"verification by credit card\" email, how to keep the setup live for at least 4 weeks (so you can charge at least $10k - for noobs), how to card correctly, tackling Stripe myths, etc.Braintree Setup - Not to many around here really know how to work with Braintree to make it lucrative. Most of people rely on myths like this one: \"Braintree is easier than Stripe, i should be doing $10k/week. But since i\\'ve tried 3-4 times and it does not work that way, Braintree is probably only for Professional lads\". Well, that might be right if you do not have the right information. You will find it inside this guide. Again, for those that fear they dont have the basisc for this guide, trust me, i touched every aspect you need to know before starting to work!Virtual Carding - Well, this is probably the most important part. It is a vast chapter of the guide. It touches everything that you need to know so you will have success in your carding. I mean really, this is really the guide you need so your carding will pass through. I dont care if you want to use my information for Gateway Processors like Stripe and Braintree, or on fashion, electronics, etc. My informations not only will help you, but it will be the step-by-step guide for your success.It might sound that i\\'m bragging, but just look into my reputation. In 4 years of DarkNet Markets ive released two full guides and one update; all of them where appreciated as among the most well written, well explained, best value guides in DarkNet.Questions and Answers - The newbies, less experienced carders around here will really, really, really appreciate this chapter, as i took the time to read most of the noobs topics started around this forum and ive selected some really important questions from them - on how, why, when, what about carding - and im giving the answers inside this guide. http://wallstyizjhkrvmj.onion/offer/3589Bank Drop Creation Guide v2.0Product DescriptionWORKS WORLDWIDE!

       " \"\\nFellow Darketeers, Psychonauts and Customers,In order to celibrate my listing @ deepdotweb.com of my vendor shop, I had a referral promotion, my promotion is finished and the winners of the rewards will be announced shortly!In case you missed it before, I have opened my own Vendor Shop, Psychedelicum, and it seems not a moment to soon after Alpha and Hansa! You can find it here --> http://dutchdr5gsol4dde.onion/auth/register, also listed @deepdotweb. Prices will be substantially lower because I have no risk of losing my money through exit scams and such, also no risk in BTC volatility, because of direct payment, I can go even lower! Check it out for yourself, at least 15%, most products will be 20 to 25% cheaper compared to regular DNM prices in my shop.It was quite a scare, but thankfully we are not comprimised in any way. I have changed all data regarding my previous multisign addresses, wallets, pgp, locations and email accounts. I never comprimised myself by using standard passwords, or the same password for multiple accounts. I never shared any personal info anywhere, ever! I've placed Dream and Valhalla on holiday because of strong rumours and logical common sense.Some food for thought, if you have a favorite vendor for certain substances, try to order with them directly. People used to be very warry for that, but if a vendor has a good reputation, it's only him who can run away, if you order through a DNM, the third party as well as the vendor could exit scam. Selective scamming and exit scamming on DNM's by vendors has been done many times, with the false sense of security of ordering at an escrow market. Many markets rule in favor of the vendor, because of money they bring in. I don't advice to start ordering through hidden wiki , do your research, but if a vendor checks out, try to avoid DNM's whenever possible. As seen with Alpha & Hansa, big markets attract much attention and LE budget, because there are many fish to catch!Active Marketshttp://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/infodesk/ … 40560A36E1DutchDrugz's Psychedelicum (NEW!)Darknet Heroes LeagueWall Street MarketTradeRouteT*chkaDream Market (Holiday)Valhalla (Holiday)★Prices:Cannabis Oil - from €30,- down to €25,- per ML.

       " '\\nI made this thread on another DNM forum, figured it would also help you guys out. Since nothing is in this section (atm) I figured I would post a few tips to help keep you guys safe.1.  Never tell anyone about your personal life. Dont talk about your age, race, religion, or location (obviously as a buyer you will have to give that info to a vendor to get your pack, but aside from that keep it to yourself). Dont mention anything that can be used to identify you, ever...2.  Use bridges with tor. Even if your ISP is not watching your traffic (like you know..).The idiot harvard student who called in that bomb thread would have never gotten caught had he either used bridges or went down the street to the local cafe ( source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/runasandvik … mb-threat/ )You can get bridges for tor here: https://bridges.torproject.org/\\xa0 If you dont know how to use them, look it up on youtube as there are not shortage of tutorials.I would also recommend not using windows. But rather tails on a usb drive (that way if LE busts in you can throw that drive in the microwave). If you plan on using ubuntu then DISABLE TRACKING! this is done by going to:settings -> Security & Privacy -> clicking the \"files and applications\" tab and moving the slider to \"off\", then be sure to also click \"search\" tab and disable the 1 setting found there.You cannot disable tracking on windows, so dont use it. To see the pros of linux over windows simply google 100 reasons why linux is better than windows.3.  Admit nothing. IF you are confronted by LE at any point say nothing. If they knock on your door, go over to the door, and LOCK IT! Then say \"I dont answer the door for police, if you need to speak with me have your dispatcher call me\" and walk away. If they had a RIGHT to question you, or evidence to lock you up THEY WOULD NOT BE FUCKING KNOCKING!!!! They would kick in the door and grab your ass. You have NO legal obligation to open the door for police. They use this as a tactic to intimidate you. Once you open it they will say something like \"we smell marijuana\", and try to intimidate you into consenting to a search. You have NO obligation to answer YOUR phone for LE either. So if they call, just let that bitch ring. DONT snitch on yourself or give them a foot hold.You have no obligation (legal) to open the door for ANYONE! That includes LE!!! Never answer questions even if it feels awkward not to. They are trying to get more evidence on you. If you had a friend that \"used what ever you say against\\xa0 you\" would you talk to that person? Exactly, so dont do it for LE!4.  Read and practice Jolly rogers guide from deepdotweb Deepdotweb.com is one of the few sites that you can trust on the dark web. They have great articles and news (which you should stay up to date on).https://www.deepdotweb.com/jolly-rogers … beginners/Seriously, read it....5. Dont brag No one likes a big mouth. Dont order drugs/anything of the darknet and brag about it. This is twice as true if you\\'re a vendor. NO ONE should know you vend on the darknet (no one IRL that is)! Keep your mouth shut about the DN aka the darknet and darknet markets if you want to stay out of cuffs.6. Consider drops Consider using drops (locations that you can have packages delivered that you DONT live at). This can be a pain in the ass for many people but it\\'s useful because now you have no connection to your physical location. I would not worry to much about this though as you can simply deny that you ordered anything (only with your lawyer present, remember NEVER talk to LE for ANY reason!!!). There is a story on deepdotweb about this very thing (someone ordering drugs then saying they did not order drugs, and having there case dropped).7. Keep it small Got the money to order 2 key\\'s of pure coke and H of the DNM? Dont. Try to keep your orders small, this way if your package does get snatched you are not out 10\\'s of thousands of dollars. You can order more frequently in this case. many vendors will hook you up for repeat orders, of if you explain you have the money for 12 orders instead of the 1. Many times the vendors actually prefer this as it\\'s easier for them too!8. Encrypt your addy yourself!As we have seen in past sites (like hansa) dont rely on the website to encrypt your address or any other information that exposes you. Do it yourself! This way you KNOW only you and the vendor know what\\'s what. If you do get a knock on the door this way you KNOW who is responsible and can warn fellow buyers!9. Use a VPN w/torUsing a VPN is an extra step but worth it. It will cost you a bit more but if you had to buy your drugs IRL you would be spending at the very least gas money. The amount you would spend in gas is probably more that what a good VPN costs you per month. Here is a link to some of the best VPN\\'s to go with: https://www.deepdotweb.com/vpn-comparison-chart/I highly suggest you buy one that allows you to pay in BTC.10. Tumble, Tumble, Tumble Always tumble your coins! If you are about to buy drugs with BTC or if you are about to cash those coins in (as a vendor) make sure you dont make it easy for LE to track you.Best of luck to you, stay safe fellow darknet citizens!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some additional tips from users who responded to my thread:Nice advice. I figure I\\'ll add and elaborate on a couple more on the legal front. Be aware though, that a lot or all of this may or may not apply in EU, Asian, Middle Eastern, or Latin American countries (because you don\\'t have as many rights as people in the US).Never let cops into your house or property without a search/arrest warrantWithout a search/arrest warrant, the police have no legal reason or right to be bothering you. Many police officers will often try to SE or intimidate someone into letting them into your house or wherever. Don\\'t fall for this like many others do. If they don\\'t have a warrant, you can kindly tell them that they cannot come inside until they get one.If police ask to search your home, car, or property, tell them clearly that you do not consent to their search. If the cops search anyway, don\\'t resist, as if they find anything and you get arrested and play it right, the \"evidence\" can get suppressed (as the search becomes illegal).Don\\'t let the police SE you\\xa0 \\xa0 \"If you don\\'t answer my questions, I\\'ll have no choice but to arrest you. Do you want to go to jail?\"\\xa0 (They will arrest you either way.)\\xa0 \\xa0 \"You\\'re not a suspect - just help us understand what happened here and then you can go.\"\\xa0 (They will arrest you after you talk.)\\xa0 \\xa0 \"If you don\\'t answer my questions, I\\'m going to charge you with resisting arrest.\" (They will arrest you either way)\\xa0 \\xa0 \"All of your friends have cooperated and we let them go home. You\\'re the only one left.\" (They will arrest you either way.)\\xa0 \\xa0 \"You are just here voluntarily and we appreciate you helping us with this. You are free to leave at any time.\" (If you try to leave, they will arrest you.)Cops are sneaky and there are lots of ways they can trick you into talking. They are allowed, even trained, to lie to you. Here are some cons they\\'ll pull:Good Cop/ Bad Cop: Bad cop is aggressive and menacing, while good cop is nice, friendly, and familiar (usually good cop is the same race and gender as you). The idea is bad cop scares you so bad you are desperately looking for a friend. Good cop is that friend, until you are done talking.The cops will tell you that your friends ratted on you so that you will snitch on them. Meanwhile, they tell your friends the same thing. If anyone breaks and talks, you all go down.The cops will tell you that they have all the evidence they need to convict you and that if you \"take responsibility\" and confess the judge will be impressed by your honesty and go easy on you. What they really mean is: \"we don\\'t have enough evidence yet, please confess\".The cops may show you something and claim it is your fingerprints, or tell you they have your fingerprints.The cops may tell you that they have you on video committing a crime. There may or may not be a video. It may or may not be someone who looks like you.Even if the cop questioning you is completely honest, he/she is human, and hears what he or she expects to hear. Jail can be a very isolating and intimidating place. It is really easy to believe what the cops tell you. Insist upon speaking with a lawyer before you answer any questions or sign anything.If arrested, say nothingYou have rights (at least in the US). The police are supposed to tell you some of them. Sometimes they will. If they don\\'t, it does not usually mean that you don\\'t get charged or convicted; it means they didn\\'t read you your rights. If they do read you your rights, take it seriously. Make them take it seriously. Ask for a lawyer. Refuse to answer questions. (Don\\'t just remain quiet, actively but politely say \"I\\'m going to remain silent. I\\'d like to see a lawyer\".)As for the notion that you \"make yourself look guilty\" by remaining silent? Big deal. If you\\'re under investigation for a serious criminal charge, it matters less what the cops think, than what the prosecutor can prove in court. If you remain silent, you\\'re at least not doing any more actual legal damage to yourself. By talking to the police, all you\\'re doing is giving evidence to hand to the prosecutor to use against you.Another thing, many time the cops will pretend to make a deal with you, usually with stuff like \"look man, you seem like a good kid and we don\\'t want to see you go to jail. If you cooperate now, I\\'ll have a word with the prosecutor and we\\'ll reduce or drop the worst charges\". This is a lie. The police are not authorized to make such deals under any circumstances, only the prosecutor can do that. By giving the police info by talking to them, you are giving up valuable leverage to maybe secure a deal with him in the future.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------More Operational Security tips- Leave fake trails: Discourage LE from investigating about you by leading them to fake routes, use an email with someone else name, register it with an hacked RDP.- Never browse hidden sites in public- Always use an encrypted laptop, never a desktop one (you can get rid of the laptop easily)\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nHello everyone!We are the UK Rails team and we run a local (national) operation. We've been around the DNMs since late 2015 and apart from market tribulations it's been a smooth ride.\\xa0 We offer season tickets for traveling in the United Kingdom. We use original ticket paper to issue our tickets and have mastered every little detail. Our tickets are known to pass on-board fraud inspection teams more than once.We have a steady pool of returning customers which has always been our goal. We like to create long-lasting business relationships with our clients based on trust, respect and professionalism. This is one of the reasons we only offer season tickets. Given it's a niche market we get the chance to pay more individual attention to new and returning customers and make sure all their needs and concerns are taken care of for years to come.In our online vending history we never had any negative feedback (or neutral for that matter). Any issues are always resolved swiftly and with care.Now for our TOS:[OUR SERVICES]Season tickets- Standard and First ClassWe can issue any season ticket that is listed on nationalrail.co.uk for a validity of 1 to 6 months.16-25 Railcard Age verification bypassIf you are older than 25 but still need a 16-25 railcard we can offer a way to order it through the legitimate website by spoofing* the age verification step.*our method does not involve any kind of identity theft, carding etc.[REQUIREMENTS]When placing an order we will need the following information:- origin and destination (does not apply for London travelcards)- duration/validity- start date- photocard number- photocard name- name and address for shipping purposesBefore you place an order you need to have a photocard for season tickets (not an oyster one). It can be issued for free at any manned station. You are advised (but it's not a requirement) to use fake details.[CUSTOMER SERVICE]Above all we take care of our customers. We always work in a professional, patient and caring manner. Our clients are treated with respect and we always try to find the best solution to any need or concern. We try to be online at least one time a day. If for any reason the market is down, you can contact us by PM on the market.[PRICES]Our prices start at 35% of the retail price of the ticket and go as low as 15% which mainly depends on the value of the ticket.The minimum order value is 150GBP per ticket. This is the minimum price you will be paying us. It is not the minimum retail price.[RESHIPS&REFUNDS]If for any reason you are unhappy with our service we will refund 100% of your order or replace the ticket. We may ask for proof of defect and/or photo/video proof of the destruction of unwanted ticket.[BULK ORDERS]We don't offer any discounts for bulk orders as we are not a large operation and can handle all the orders we receive in the same manner.[SHIPPING&DELIVERY TIME]We always use Royal Mail First Class postage option and usually ship the next day. You can expect your tickets in 2 days however we ask for 3-5 days in case of postal delays or any other issues. Shipping is free of charge.For quotes and questions, please send us a message. We work mainly by creating custom listings upon demand. For London travelcards, please check our fixed listings first (coming shortly).Thank you!Kind regards,The UK Rails team--------------------------------------------------------------------Our username on the market is UKRailsOur info listing: • WSM Mirror 1 - http://wallstyizjhkrvmj.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 2 - http://wallst4qihu6lvsa.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 3 - http://wallst3gi4a5wtn4.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 4 - http://wallst2qs75qkzzn.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 5 - http://wallst52pxrtzwch.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 6 - http://wallst7xs4tepmvb.onion/offer/9455 • WSM Mirror 7 - http://wallst6gyljfu4rk.onion/offer/9455\\n\",\n",

With that being said, so long as you didn't use it over cell network you would remain as anonymous as your opsec/current network in use allows, given you do everything right. You can emulate Android in Virtual Box or vmWare or QEMU or just about any virtual machine software on most Linux distros.. Would use one of these depending on your personal needs/tastes: Android x86, Phoenix OS, Remix OS, etc. You can even install every single one of these directly on your PC without a virtual machine, Phoenix and Remix for example make Android look more like a desktop, you can also achieve this with vanilla Android x86 + custom launcher (Play Store/Web/etc), there's quite a few made for tablets etc that work just as well for an actual desktop/laptop setup.

We are unlike most of the other LSD vendors you know already, because we do not mass-produce our product on printed sheets. Instead all of our tabs are hand-cut and painted with non-toxic watercolor paints in small batches.Our philosophy came about because we wanted to combine our love of original art with our love for psychedelics. We took inspiration from the 1960s acid pioneers, and from local farmers markets, where unique artisanal food products are produced by hand. We decided that we could bring the same approach to the production of LSD.Currently we offer a mini sheet of 20 tabs fully dosed at 100-100ug, and a 30 day supply of 10ug microdose tabs, which were our most popular product on Alphabay. We will be expanding our range in the future.\\xa0 Each mini sheet and microdose sheet has a unique design, and you can even request your own design at no extra cost.\\xa0 If you'd like to see some of our old designs, you can view them on our website at http://newshit5g5lc5coc.onion/.\\nnew shit.Hand-painted LSD tabs and microdose tabsOur store: http://wallstyizjhkrvmj.onion/profile/newshit\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nGreetings, FelineKing here. I would like to share my story.The Dark Net? Whats that? I was asking myself this question back in 2015 when the May edition of Wired came out. I have no background in technology, just like reading about different subjects while gaining useless knowledge (for myself anyway) On the front cover of the May edition I found \"Hit Men! Drugs! Bitcoin! The Epic Saga Of Silk Road\" I still remember where I was sitting when I read it. I treat it like it\\'s a religious text. Of course I know now that some of the information in it was total B.S. but it still left a profound impact on me. The article lays out the backstory of Ross Ulbricht and the events leading up to his capture. Fast forward a few days and I\\'m trying to figure out how to use Tor! I had no idea what I was doing or what I was getting into, but I was hooked. After configuring Tor and doing a search for \"Dark Net\" and browsing around I found a link to BlackBank Bitcoin Market. I was like a kid in a candy store! The amount of goods and services was mind blowing to a guy living in small town U.S.A. I never got a chance to purchase anything though for two reasons. First I had no Bitcoin, and no good way of purchasing any. Then to my amazement when I tried to log in to my account one day the site was gone! I had suffered my first Dark Net heartbreak. Since then I have lingered on Outlaw, Middle Earth, Alphabay, Hansa, and Dream. As most of you know these are all gone (except Dream... questionable) but I had great contacts and a 100% success rate with receiving all my orders including asthma meds. (no biggie) and hash. So here I am! Now falling in love with WSM. I never had interest in the forums on the other markets, besides Dream in the last few weeks because of problems with the market.

       " '\\nProduct: 5 grams VICE , Bubblegum 50%, Critical Mass 2.0 50% mix (Purchased through Hansa) Shipping: Less than 7 days to US. Vacuum sealed, good stealth. Review: Not a big smoker, prefer edibles. I did take a toke and the effects were immediately felt behind the eyes with a nice body high. I infused the hash into some coconut oil for a late evening treat/sleeping med. This is a knockout mix, very strong spicy smell upon breaking the seal on the package. Looking forward to trying some of their other listings. If you have not heard of CNA or read their VICE article I would recommend it, you can find it on their vendor profile. Long live CNA! Long live el Patron!\\n\"There is so much in this world that I do not understand. See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply. I have absolutely no idea how it works.

       " \"\\nThanks for purchasing the guide!It is about cashing out your CCs to BTC. Let's get to the point.You will need:- Ccs- Facebook- Photo Exif Editor App- Anonymous Offshore CC with IBAN attached (optional, but good for quick big cashouts)If you are outside of US, UK or EU you will need a VPN matching with one of those countries. Website we are going to use has no security, but I'd recommend using at least VPN/RDP/Socks5.METHOD:You are going to use 9flats.com website for your CC-> BTC operation.This website works in EU, US and many other countries. Chargebacks are not permitted so you can card and have very small change to get #D Secure gateway. In the FAQ they mention about MS secure code and Visa vbv but don't worry about it. 1) Day 1: Open an account on 9flats.com with fake e-mail. For the first 3 days log in to your account, visit the website, take a look at other listing, upload your profile picture with exif datas (use facebook and exif editor mentioned above).2) During these 3 days you will need to pick up some pictures of flats for rent. The best way to do itis groups on Facebook. Just type: flat for rent + Berlin (or any other city). Ever day new listing are posted on Facebook so it's easy to find something. Once you have those pictures, change EXIF data.This is a very important step. Image has to be in .jpg format, it's VERY IMPORTANT!3) After these 3 days create your listing on 9 flats, the best wat is to make a good standing flat in a clean place (for example $150-$200). Choose “booking request”.Put periods of unavailability to look like a normal host. Then you will need to wait 48-72 before your listing is published. 4) After that time your listing should be online. Log-in on a regular basis, every day for the whole week, to look like a regular customer.5) 1 Week after day 1 open a customer account (use details from CC you want to use) and act like a real customer. Check out other listing in your area. Ask questions to other users for 4 days and after 3-4 days send message to your seller account and next day, card your own listing.6) Once everything is ok you will receive an e-mail from 9flats. Wait a few hours before the booking and the payout.From payout preferences choose “bitcoin” from dropdown menu and provide your btc address. I'd recommend running it through Helix (bitcoin mixer).TIPS1) If after your booking you have only 1 cashout option option: “Payment in cash” it means there was something wrong with your process. Luckily, you can bypass it. Just make a booking on the day about 1 month from current day, and this will remove payment in cash and will allow you to cashout in bitcoin.2) If all goes good, you won't need phone number. But if you need it you can use google voice or sonotel: http://sonotel.com/en/l/home. Just card it with your cc.3) Create at least 1 new account every week to scale up your operations.4) I recommend using business cards like gold MS, Visa platinum, or AMEX. With those card you should easily card $400-$500.FAQQ : Can you recommend me a reliable CC vendor ?A : Yes, I advise you : st0n3d and oneSellerUsaCC here on AlphaBay,Smart666Tiger on DreamMarket.Q : Can you recommend me a good VPN / socks provider ?A : Yes : Pure VPN, Express VPN and Torguard.Q : There is only bank transfer option, why ?A : No worries about that, 9flats have removed the bitcoin optionfrom the payout preferences but this option is still aviable at thewithdraw process.After your 1st booking and completed payment you will get thefunds in your balance, then just click : Account > Credit > Withdrawbutton and choose « bitcoin » in the dropdown menu + fill the fieldwhere your bitcoin address will be required.Q : I did not understand what you wrote about anon CCA : CC with iban attached is an e-wallet which accept bitcoin andallow you to pay / withdraw and make deposits, they provide amastercard (physical card).How to get it ?- You will need a drop (or stick a label with the fake name you’vechoosen on your mailbox ) and remove it after delivery, you will needa fake ID scan + fake residence proof scan for your accountverification.On 9flats using this card will allow you to make a fake non-fraudulent booking, so this will make you more credible with 9flatsand lifetime of your host account will be extended (over 3 weeksagainst 2 weeks max without anon CC). contact info removed please read the rules - dabbingtimes\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nEnergy Control Sample Code: ZFFF5964 dated July 12th, 2017My apologies for kicking this review out much later than expected. Between at first being back logged on reviewing various batches and then the LE shut down of a couple (or more) DNMs, I’ve been wary of posting until things calmed down a little. A couple weeks ago, there for a few days it was difficult to even get in touch with many known vendors and I was wondering about my uploads to the DN being compromised.This is the third such review I have posted for GiveMeSleep. This batch arrived to me via USPS Priority Mail, as the previous two were sent first class mail. GMS has been working on his stealth and shipping and I been communicating with him on what I see to make improvements. This last batch arrived alright, but as someone that has received quite a few packs from the many vendors over the last three years now, I am more critical than probably many others. My minor complaint with this arrival was how it was “final sealed” as in how the very product was last contained. It was not in a zip baggie or the like, but rather it was sealed within a small self-made pocket of mylar. It was very tricky to remove all the product and I noticed once I got most all the sample out of the mylar and then licked the mylar, there was a metalic taste to the remaining powder. (However I have not noticed it when trying the sample out.)A couple weeks ago I had all the notes prepared for this review and all I needed to do was “develop” the images and turn those notes into a review. But... right after AB went down there just happened to be a local cop car parked at the neighboring apartment and I sort of panicked and got rid of a lot of my “questionable” items, one being those notes. So some of this is on memory of those notes, plus I saved most of this sample sent and so I am “reviewing” it again as I write this review.The product came in a nice combination of chunks and powder. The chunks are on the soft side and hot plating would be recommended. The sample was right on as far as the weight goes. The humidity here lately has been higher than normal and I do not truly remember this batch being quite this soft a couple weeks ago. When doing the “fingertip” test, the sample quickly totally disappeared with no residue remaining. I did notice though that the slickness or oiliness that I usually observe was not there as prevalently as most of the fingertip tests reveal. The taste was that of an alkaloid/chemical bitterness and no noticeable taste of petroleum. The numbness showed up about a minute later and was mild and clean-like.The water test showed the small amount in a spoon melted into two drops of water very nicely with very little residue remaining and when moved slightly the rest dissipated nicely. The water solution in the mouth was bitter, but not overly so and again no hint of petroleum was noticed.Most likely wherever you received this batch at, it would be a good idea to probably “hot plate” the cola before chopping/shaving it into lines. This batch shaves very nicely into beautiful, pearlescent flakes, that keep shaving into smaller and smaller flakes until there is a fluffiness like snow. (Exactly the type of product I like to play with as I enjoy the shaving of cocaine.)This batch goes up the old nozzola very nicely, with no noticeable “bite” or stinging whatsoever. I was starting to notice a pleasant feeling coming on in about eight or so minutes and a nice clear headed “buzz” or euphoria in about 15 minutes. When I originally was testing out this batch, I was thinking that I liked this batch maybe a little better than the previous batch from GMS that I reviewed. It has a very pleasant “feel” to it that allows me to get my sit down work done without any edgeness and when I took this batch out for a test run at the tavern a couple weeks ago, I remember it was a perfect match with my favorit alcoholic beverage.From what I have seen, GMS has been very consistent with his batches of cocaine and he is certainly trying to be one of the more trusted and respected cola vendors that are still left on the DNMs. You can find GiveMeSleep on WallStreet Market = http://wallstyizjhkrvmj.onion/profile/GiveMeSleepTradeRoute = http://4wgyje4xhbqqskan.onion/?page=pro … iveMeSleepDream = http://lchudifyeqm4ldjj.onion/contactMe … iveMeSleepWhen the results for Energy Control come in, I will be posting them to this review on the CCC Onion website.

We have extended the downtime in an effort to optimize organization, locations and security measures.

You can find it here --> http://dutchdr5gsol4dde.onion/auth/register. It\\'s also listed at DeepDotWeb. Prices are substantially lower because I have no risk of losing my money through exit scams and such, also no risk in BTC volatility, because of direct payment, I can go even lower! Check it out for yourself! Also a reminder, all data of us has been changed, multisign, pgp, email, you name it, so don\\'t be alarmed, I still have acces to all old data if you wish to check.- Big price drop XTC pills, now down from 3 down to 2 euro\\'s, Spongebob XTC, 160-180 mg MDMA!- Big price drops in the future, am upscaling our buyin process!- Next promotion will be free lsd, keep an eye on dutchdrugzsupport on Reddit!- Sadly a price increase for 4-ACO-DMT & HCL Mescaline, last stock, gone after that!- We now have high quality Cannabis oil, this is the real deal, no dillution, only endocannabinoids, 50% sativa, 50% indica, the best of both worlds .- 10 ML listings of Cannabis oil available, only 25 euro\\'s per ML!- We now also offer Changa, besides our usual n,n DMT, you can now opt for Changa (some people prefer that to n,n dmt for smoother smoke and longer duration)- ETH & XMR are now accepted, DASH too if any market decides to add it!- Friendly warning not to use Apple Market, they are scamming their vendors and buyers with funds!- Dream and Valhalla are most likely also comprimised!For those who don\\'t know me, I\\'m a top vendor from EVO with over 4000 sales and a longtime entrepreneur in the offline Dutch drugtrade.

(he uses loans to make this kind of money apparently). its been about 3 weeks since i put my order in, and now he is not returning my calls/texts. in his defense he said that it takes about 2-3 weeks for the CPN to get into the credit bureau. maybe you could confirm this information or if he is just scamming me/ telling me some bullshit? the first time i placed an order i texted/called him after a month of placing the order, and he started telling me how his grandma was in the hospital, and hes dealing with shit. i feel like he never really put my order because the name requested was different than the one on the ID. on top of all that he sent me screenshots of logging into Credit Karma and showing me that this account has a credit score of 780 or so. but when i tried to login it only had a score of 650 or so. (im guessing he took out a loan, and never paid it back so his score went down). he did tell me that Tradelines are what make the score that high (750+) maybe you could confirm that too? i will check

       " '\\nLet me begin by saying this is a document I thought it would be a good idea to hang on to.. I forgot who the real author is but give credit to that guy!\\xa0 It has been worth the read since it came out, So I\\'ll post it here to keep legends alive! Enjoy folks! -TITW-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=I wrote this because I noticed a lot of vendors here at /r/fakeid ship only via First Class mail without tracking. I have to assume at least some of you fellas aren\\'t aware of this information. This is not an end-all, be-all guide. Some people have good ideas that aren\\'t included here, but following the instructions here will work.Note: Postal rates, fees and programs change almost yearly now, usually in January. This info is accurate as of 1st September 2015.1. $5.75 stamps - Go into a post office and ask to buy a \"$5.75 stamp\" (commonly known as a \"Priority Mail stamp\" though not officially called that) and a \"tracking sticker\". If they ask to see your Priority Mail envelope (sometimes they expect you to be handing them a mail piece that\\'s addressed and ready to mail), say that you do not have it with you and you just want to buy the stamp and tracking sticker to put on your Priority Mail envelope at home. You do not have to buy just one stamp at a time. You can buy as many $5.75 stamps as you like at once, and they will give you a free tracking sticker to go with each stamp you buy. Bonus: buy 20 of these stamps at once, and they will come as a sheet which you can request the postal worker to put into a wax paper envelope for you. This way you won\\'t have to touch the stamps. Pay for the stamps with cash! Technically, you can just buy regular First Class Forever stamps and stick them in a row on your Priority Mail until you get to $5.75 in value, but that looks really bad and is totally unprofessional.2. Tracking Stickers - Assuming you asked for the tracking sticker(s) with the stamp(s), they will also give you a free tracking sticker with a tracking # on it for each $5.75 stamp you buy. The tracking sticker(s) are free of charge if you buy these stamps. There are 400 tracking stickers on a roll, and the stickers are technically free, but postal workers tend to be stingy with them, guarding them like surly trolls at a bridge. Many of them will not freely give the tracking stickers to you unless you buy stamps too. You can ask for as many stickers as you like, and they should give them to you on the spot even if you did not buy ANYTHING, but it is not guaranteed that they will be willing to do that. I\\'ve heard postal workers object to giving out stickers because \"people use the tracking sticker wrong\" by putting them on regular First Class mail expecting to be able to track mail that is not sent via Priority Mail. If you explain that you have a large number of $5.75 stamps at home, that you send Priority Mail out daily, and you know how to use the tracking stickers properly, they might just be convinced hand you the rest of their tracking sticker roll if you ask nicely.3. Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelopes - On your way out of the post office grab one (or more) of the glossy Priority Mail envelopes you see next to the Priority Mail flat rate shipping boxes. They should be on a display stand somewhere in the lobby, not behind the counter (although they have them back there too). These envelopes and boxes are all free for people who have bought Priority Mail postage stamps. The following are the flat rate envelopes that cost $5.75 to mail (with or without tracking):\\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Flat Rate Envelope [12-1/2\" x 9-1/2\"]\\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Small Flat Rate Envelope [10\" x 6\"]\\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Gift Card Flat Rate Envelope [10\" x 7\"]\\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Window Flat Rate Envelope [10\" x 5\" or 12-1/2\" x 9-1/2\"]The above are all glossy envelopes colored white with red borders that clearly say \"PRIORITY MAIL\" on them. I\\'ve seen some all blue Priority Mail envelopes, and those will work too, but most of them are white with red top and bottom borders. Just make sure it does not say \"Express Mail\" on it (those are white with blue borders) because the Post Office WILL HAVE PROBLEMS with your mail if you use an Express Mail envelope with only enough postage for Priority Mail.Since they cost more to mail, unless you put extra postage stamps on the outside of the below envelopes/boxes, DO NOT get the following:\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Padded Flat Rate Envelope [12-1/2\" x 9-1/2\"] (costs $6.10)\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Small Flat Rate Box [12-1/2\" x 9-1/2\"] (costs $5.95)\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Legal Flat Rate Envelope [15\" x 9-1/2\"] (costs $5.90)\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Priority Mail™ Tyvek Envelope [15 1/8\" x 11 5/8\"] (costs $? ...more)You can just go into any post office and grab a stack of these Priority Mail flat rate envelopes / boxes and walk out. Just say \"I already have stamps\" if they give you any guff. If they still protest, just go to a different post office or come in near closing time when the line is super long and they are busy. They shouldn\\'t care if you take these flat rate envelopes or boxes. I repeat: these Priority Mail (and Express Mail, btw) envelopes & boxes are free for people who have purchased stamps.Also on your way out of the post office, you may want to grab a stack of those white and red \"Priority Mail\" address label stickers that are commonly found next to the Priority Mail flat rate envelopes. Only do that if you write your address labels by hand. Getting these address label stickers is optional since they are not required (you can just write addresses or put home printed address label stickers directly on the Priority Mail flat rate envelopes). These stickers are only useful if you write out addresses by hand which looks a bit unprofessional but works just fine. I suggest you print out address labels since hand-written addresses is one of the suspicious mail indicators used to profile contraband mail. More on this next.4. Envelope preparation - You can do this part at home.\\xa0 \\xa0 Put the product you are mailing in a (small) regular letter sized \"security envelope\" (found in the stationary section of grocery stores, office supply stores, drug stores, etc), and seal it with some printer paper or magazine paper for padding on the inside. Make sure the envelope can\\'t be seen through.\\xa0 \\xa0 Write or print the customer\\'s address on this small letter envelope; this will be useful in the totally remote chance that your outer Priority Mail envelope gets damaged (by weather, sorting machines, etc) and the Post Office can no longer read the delivery address on the outside of the Priority Mail envelope.\\xa0 \\xa0 Put the regular letter envelope (with product sealed inside) inside a larger Priority Mail flat rate envelope which you grabbed at the post office. Seal this Priority Mail envelope.\\xa0 \\xa0 On the same side of the Priority Mail envelope that has the seal & flap, put the customer\\'s address in the \"to/recipient\" address section. You should see this section marked on the envelope (unless of course you are using one of the Priority Mail \"Window\" Flat Rate envelopes). To the left of the customer\\'s address, affix your tracking sticker. Above the customer\\'s address, near the top right, affix your $5.75 postage stamp. This can go on the flap or below it. Do not cover the postage stamp with tape (even if the tape is clear) whatever you do. The post office needs to cancel the stamp, and they cannot do that if there is tape over it.\\xa0 \\xa0 Make sure you note which tracking # belongs to which customer.Other shipping pro-tips regarding return addresses:\\xa0 \\xa0 Always include a return address.\\xa0 \\xa0 Always use a return address with a zip code close to or in the zip code from which you ship.\\xa0 \\xa0 Use a REAL & VERIFIABLE business name & address for the return address (but for the love of god, not YOUR real one!). Crack open your YellowPages and choose a business at random to save time. I suggest going to the Print Shops section, considering your product. The return address should change every time you ship a new batch.Failing to do any of the above makes your mail piece more suspicious. Also:\\xa0 \\xa0 While packaging up the product and prepping the envelope, use gloves so your fingerprints do not get on any of this stuff. One layer of latex gloves is NOT ENOUGH to protect you from leaving latent prints! Use those blue nitrile gloves with the fingertip bumps you can purchase at drug stores & grocery stores.\\xa0 \\xa0 When buying stamps and touching things in the post office, either be very careful not to touch the items that you use later for shipping (for example: touch only one of the tracking stickers they give you, mark it so you know which one you touched, and don\\'t use that one), or put liquid bandage on your hands before you go to the post office. You can find liquid bandage at drug stores and pharmacies in the band aide section. It comes in a bottle, and dries on your skin to make a thin, clear coat that seals in moisture.\\xa0 \\xa0 DO NOT try to send Priority Mail via Click-N-Ship or with a Stamps.com or similar account. This is not anonymous, and many people have been busted because they mailed stuff this way.\\xa0 \\xa0 DO NOT order the free of cost offers on USPS.com for Priority Mail envelopes or tracking stickers and have them sent to you! There are serial numbers inside the Priority Mail envelopes (just look in there, you\\'ll see them) which are used for investigation purposes, and I would hope it is needless to say there are numbers on the tracking stickers. They keep track of what they send and to whom. You do not want one of your Priority Mail packs to be tracked back to an address that is in any way associated with you or anyone you know.\\xa0 \\xa0 If you have a large number of tracking stickers, DO NOT use the stickers in sequential order off the roll for each new pack you send out. Take the stickers from random places on the roll so that the tracking numbers you send are not all sequentially ordered and any investigator cannot guess which tracking number will be on your next Priority Mail envelope. If they can figure out the tracking number your envelopes will have on them, they can pull them from the mail stream as soon as they are scanned into the system at the acceptance stage and cause big problems for your customers and for you. There are OPSEC advantages and disadvantages to not being able to get a whole roll of tracking stickers and only buying tracking stickers in small quantities as they are needed.5. Mailing your orders outDo not just go back to the post office to mail your orders! You\\'ll be on camera mailing those, and that is straight up stupid. You don\\'t have to do that! You can now drop off as many of those Priority Mail envelopes in any of the USPS blue bins you see all around town. The only things you have to go into a post office to mail are:\\xa0 \\xa0 International mail pieces that are not letters\\xa0 \\xa0 Mail pieces that weigh 13 oz\\'s or more, envelope included (FYI: 16 oz = 1 lb)\\xa0 \\xa0 Mail pieces that are too big to fit through the slot in one of the blue drop off binsSo that you don\\'t have to get your fingerprints on the outside of these Priority Mail envelopes one last time, either wear gloves for drop off or, as I\\'ve seen suggested elsewhere, put all these envelopes you are dropping into a larger brown/manilla envelope that they will all fit in. Place the open end of this big envelope down into the blue bin drop box opening and shake the Priority Mail envelopes out of this larger envelope into the drop box until the larger envelope is empty. Keep the large envelope for your next drop off (don\\'t drop it in the blue bin). Congrats you just stepped your game up a notch or two.Yippee! Now you can anonymously mail out orders & track them so you know if they actually got delivered. If you copy/paste & print your customers\\' shipping addresses, it will be their fault if you see on the tracking that the mail piece was RTS (returned to sender) marked \"UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED\" or \"ADDRESSEE UNKNOWN.\" No reship for those clowns.BTW, you can send Express Mail very similarly (with signature waived!) although it is a little more cumbersome and costs about 4x more. I can also tell you how to do that if anyone wants to know.\\nVisit my Shop:http://wallstyizjhkrvmj.onion/profile/ThisIsTheWhyLatest Pic of Product:http://u57yg5ons3m4lgvg.onion/image.php?di=NPDSBeginners Guide to the DarkNet:http://x7bwsmcore5fmx56.onion/viewtopic.php?id=2777\\n',\n",

Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production. There are some major differences between us and the UG labs out there that are selling inferior products besides the fact that we adhere to GMP standards. We use Safflower oil as the carrier oil in our injectables for two reasons. First, it’s the thinnest possible carrier oil which means it’s easier to load a syringe, and less possible injection site soreness. Second, it’s just plain healthier for you. We also use proper amounts of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate so there is less chance of injection site soreness. UG labs will use excessive amounts to keep their product from crashing because they don’t really understand what they are doing.All of our products are shipped from within the U.S. so you do not need to worry about customs or seizures. We have no minimum order amount, can custom design cycles, and can fulfill any bulk order.\\xa0 Bulk orders do receive a discount depending on the amount ordered.
